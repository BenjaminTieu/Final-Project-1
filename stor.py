# Note that each dictionary should generally be created in such a way that:
#   The first key of the embedded dictionary corresponds to the name of the
#       indicated entity.
#   The second key of the embedded dictionary corresponds to the description
#       of the entity. If the entity does not have a description, then the
#       second key and beyond of the embedded dictionary can instead be the
#       attributes associated with the entity
#       (i.e. Strength, Dexterity, etc.)
#   Any key of the embedded list beyond the first two correspond to the
#       attributes associated with the entity (if not already used)
